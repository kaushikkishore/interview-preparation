### Books
Books provide a structured, in-depth foundation and are great for reference and self-paced learning.

1. **"Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell**
   - **Why**: The gold standard for coding interview prep. Covers 189 problems with detailed solutions, explanations of key DSA concepts, and interview tips specific to FAANG companies.
   - **How to Use**: Read chapters on arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc., then solve 5-10 problems per topic. Focus on the “Hints” section to mimic interview thinking.
   - **Level**: Beginner to Advanced (perfect for your current stage).

2. **"Introduction to Algorithms" (CLRS) by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein**
   - **Why**: A comprehensive resource for DSA theory. Deep dives into algorithms like sorting, graph traversal, and dynamic programming—FAANG loves candidates who understand the "why" behind solutions.
   - **How to Use**: Use as a reference, not a cover-to-cover read. Study specific sections (e.g., Chapter 22 for graphs) when you encounter a weak area. Pair with practice.
   - **Level**: Intermediate to Advanced (skip if time-constrained).

3. **"Elements of Programming Interviews" (EPI) by Aziz, Lee, Prakash**
   - **Why**: Tailored for FAANG-style interviews with 250+ problems across languages (Python, Java, C++). Focuses on practical coding and optimization.
   - **How to Use**: Solve problems topic-wise (e.g., binary search, DP). Compare your solution with theirs to refine your approach.
   - **Level**: Intermediate to Advanced.

4. **"Algorithms Unlocked" by Thomas Cormen**
   - **Why**: A simpler, beginner-friendly version of CLRS. Great for reinforcing basics like BFS, DFS, and greedy algorithms in an accessible way.
   - **How to Use**: Read it early on to solidify your foundational understanding before diving into harder problems.
   - **Level**: Beginner to Intermediate.

   - **Best For**: Theory and intuition.

4. **Back To Back SWE**
   - **Why**: Breaks down complex problems (e.g., dynamic programming, system design) with step-by-step logic tailored to FAANG interviews.
   - **How to Use**: Watch his problem-solving videos to learn how to verbalize your thought process—a key interview skill.
   - **Best For**: Medium-to-hard problems, interview simulation.

5. **Tushar Roy - Coding Made Simple**
   - **Why**: Focuses on DSA with detailed whiteboard-style explanations. Great for dynamic programming and graph problems.
   - **How to Use**: Use his playlists (e.g., “Dynamic Programming”) to master tricky topics after you’ve practiced basics.
   - **Best For**: Advanced topics.

   - **Cost**: Free / $99 for premium.
   - **Level**: Beginner to Advanced.

2. **"Grokking the Coding Interview" (Educative.io)**
   - **Why**: Teaches DSA through patterns (e.g., sliding window, two pointers) rather than rote memorization. FAANG interviewers love pattern-based thinking.
   - **How to Use**: Complete one pattern (e.g., “Two Pointers”) per week, solving all associated problems. Practice explaining solutions aloud.
   - **Cost**: $59/year (Educative subscription).
   - **Level**: Intermediate to Advanced.

3. **"Algorithms, Part I & II" by Robert Sedgewick (Coursera)**
   - **Why**: Princeton-level course with a strong focus on theory and implementation (Java). Covers everything from sorting to graph algorithms.
   - **How to Use**: Take Part I for basics, Part II for advanced topics (e.g., network flow). Pair with LeetCode practice.
   - **Cost**: Free to audit / $49 for certificate.
   - **Level**: Beginner to Advanced.

4. **"Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms" by Andrei Neagoie (Udemy)**
