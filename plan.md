### Updated 3-6 Month Plan to Master DSA for FAANG
With Educative.io added, the plan now emphasizes pattern mastery earlier, leveraging *Grokking the Coding Interview* to accelerate your ability to tackle unfamiliar problems. Here’s the revised roadmap (2-3 hours daily):

#### Month 1: Foundations & Early Patterns
**Goal**: Solidify basics, introduce patterns, and build problem-solving confidence.
- **CtCI**: Read Chapters 1-3 (Arrays/Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks/Queues). Solve 2-3 problems per chapter (e.g., “Two Sum,” “Reverse a Linked List”).
- **Udemy**: Complete Andrei’s sections on Arrays, Linked Lists, and Stacks/Queues. Code along with examples.
- **Educative.io**: Start *Grokking the Coding Interview*—complete “Sliding Window” and “Two Pointers” patterns (e.g., “Maximum Sum Subarray,” “Pair with Target Sum”). Solve all exercises.
- **NeetCode**: Watch videos for 10-15 easy LeetCode problems tied to these patterns (e.g., “Valid Parentheses,” “Merge Two Sorted Lists”). Attempt first, then compare.
- **Practice**: Solve 30-40 easy LeetCode problems (use NeetCode’s list). Time yourself at 20-30 minutes each.
- **Focus**: Brute force first, optimize with patterns (e.g., two pointers). Calculate time/space complexity.

**Milestone**: Solve easy problems in 20 minutes with clean, pattern-based code.

---

#### Month 2: Pattern Mastery & Medium Problems
**Goal**: Deepen pattern recognition and tackle medium difficulty with ease.
- **CtCI**: Read Chapters 4-6 (Trees/Graphs, Bit Manipulation, Math/Logic). Solve 3-5 problems per chapter (e.g., “Invert Binary Tree,” “Number of 1 Bits”).
- **Udemy**: Finish Andrei’s sections on Trees, Graphs, and Searching/Sorting. Do all coding exercises.
- **Educative.io**: Complete *Grokking* patterns: “Fast & Slow Pointers,” “Merge Intervals,” “BFS/DFS” (e.g., “Cycle in Linked List,” “Number of Islands”). Solve exercises.
- **NeetCode**: Watch videos for 15-20 medium problems (e.g., “Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters,” “Course Schedule”). Focus on pattern application.
- **Practice**: Solve 40-50 medium LeetCode problems. Aim for 25-35 minutes each. Mix CtCI and Educative problems.
- **Focus**: Verbalize your approach (e.g., “This looks like a sliding window problem…”). Test edge cases.

**Milestone**: Solve medium problems in 30 minutes using optimal patterns.

---

#### Month 3: Advanced Topics & Hard Problems
**Goal**: Master DP, graphs, and hard problems—FAANG’s bread and butter.
- **CtCI**: Read Chapters 8-10 (Recursion, DP, System Design). Solve 3-5 problems per chapter (e.g., “Fibonacci Number,” “Longest Palindromic Substring”).
- **Udemy**: Complete Andrei’s DP, Greedy, and Advanced Graph sections. Solve harder challenges.
- **Educative.io**: Finish *Grokking* patterns: “Dynamic Programming,” “Topological Sort,” “Greedy” (e.g., “Knapsack,” “Task Scheduling”). Solve all exercises.
- **NeetCode**: Watch videos for 10-15 hard problems (e.g., “Median of Two Sorted Arrays,” “Word Ladder”). Focus on DP and graph optimizations.
- **Practice**: Solve 20-30 hard LeetCode problems. Start at 45 minutes, reduce to 35-40. Revisit medium problems for speed.
- **Focus**: Break problems into subproblems (e.g., DP state). If stuck, use Educative’s pattern hints.

**Milestone**: Solve hard problems in 40 minutes with clear, optimized logic.

---

#### Month 4-5: FAANG Interview Simulation
**Goal**: Build speed, confidence, and FAANG-specific skills under time pressure.
- **CtCI**: Use Chapter 11 (Testing) and revisit 20-30 problems across topics. Time yourself at 30-45 minutes each.
- **Udemy**: Do Andrei’s mock interview sections. Practice explaining aloud.
- **Educative.io**: Review all *Grokking* patterns. Solve 15-20 problems from “Grokking Dynamic Programming for Coding Interviews” or “Grokking the Advanced System Design Interview” (if available) for bonus prep.
- **NeetCode**: Pick 20-30 FAANG-tagged problems from NeetCode 150 (e.g., Google: “Word Break,” Amazon: “LRU Cache”). Watch post-attempt.
- **Practice**: Solve 40-50 problems (medium/hard mix) in 60-minute mock interviews (LeetCode mock or a friend). Alternate CtCI, Educative, and LeetCode.
- **Focus**: Polish communication—explain trade-offs (e.g., “Hash map vs. array?”). Handle follow-ups confidently.

**Milestone**: Solve 1-2 problems in 60 minutes with optimal code and explanation.

---

#### Month 6 (Optional): Polish & Specialize
**Goal**: Refine skills and target specific FAANG companies.
- **CtCI**: Solve 20-30 harder problems from the back. Review FAANG tips (Chapter 1).
- **Udemy**: Rewatch Andrei’s Big-O and optimization sections.
- **Educative.io**: Revisit tricky *Grokking* patterns (e.g., “Top K Elements,” “Subsets”). Explore other courses like “Grokking the Behavioral Interview” (if available).
- **NeetCode**: Revisit tough problems (e.g., “N-Queens,” “Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree”). Study company-specific patterns.
- **Practice**: Solve 20-30 company-tagged LeetCode problems (e.g., “Amazon Top 50”). Do 2-3 mock interviews weekly.
- **Focus**: Perfect edge cases and code readability (FAANG loves this).

**Milestone**: Consistently ace 60-minute mock interviews.

---

### Weekly Breakdown (2-3 Hours Daily)
- **30-45 Minutes**: Study (CtCI chapter, Udemy section, or Educative pattern).
- **1-1.5 Hours**: Solve 2-3 problems (LeetCode, CtCI, or Educative exercises).
- **30 Minutes**: Review (NeetCode video, Educative solution, or CtCI explanation). Log mistakes.

---

### Total Problem Target
- **150-200 problems**: 50 easy (Month 1), 75 medium (Months 2-3), 50 hard (Months 3-5).
- Sources: 50% LeetCode (NeetCode-guided), 30% CtCI, 20% Educative exercises.
