### How to Use These in the Interview
- **Pick 3-5**: You won’t have time for all 15 in 45 minutes, so choose based on the flow. Save 5-10 minutes at the end for questions (e.g., after intros, technical, and behavioral sections).
- **Tailor to Context**: If they mention Go, ask #4. If they focus on team dynamics, go with #7 or #9.
- **Show Curiosity**: Frame them conversationally: “I noticed X in the job description—can you tell me more about Y?”
- **Tie to You**: After their answer, briefly connect it to your experience: “That’s great—my work on CostGuard involved similar optimization challenges.”

#### Sample Flow
- After technical discussion: #5 (TDD) → “I’ve used TDD with Go suites in CostGuard—excited to see how that fits here.”
- Mid-interview: #7 (team structure) → “I’ve synced with product teams a lot; glad to hear there’s PM support.”
- Closing: #10 (work-life balance) → “That sounds balanced—definitely aligns with what I’m looking for.”
