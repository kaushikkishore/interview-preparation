### Introduction for the Interview
Hi, I’m Kaushik Kishore, a Senior Staff Engineer with over 10 years of experience in cloud infrastructure, distributed systems, and data engineering. I’ve spent my career building scalable, cost-efficient solutions, like reducing AWS costs by 25-40% through optimization at Astuto AI, and designing fault-tolerant architectures for multi-account resource analysis at scale. I’m passionate about leveraging technologies like Go, Python, AWS, and Kubernetes to solve complex problems, while mentoring teams to drive technical excellence. I’m excited to bring my expertise in cloud cost optimization, CI/CD pipelines, and multitenant systems to JumpCloud, a company I admire for its innovative approach to simplifying IT management through a unified platform.

## Why JumpCloud
I’m drawn to JumpCloud because it’s tackling a critical challenge in modern IT—unifying identity, access, and device management into a single, cloud-based platform. I’ve spent much of my career optimizing cloud infrastructure and building tools that empower teams to work efficiently, like my work on CloudScope and CostGuard, which align closely with JumpCloud’s mission to simplify and secure IT operations. I’m particularly impressed by JumpCloud’s commitment to supporting diverse environments—Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android—which resonates with my experience in multitenant architectures and cross-platform solutions. I’m excited to join a fast-paced, innovative team where I can contribute to impactful projects, grow alongside talented engineers, and help organizations achieve secure, frictionless access to their resources.


### Answers to Clarifying Questions (for Interview)

#### 1. Experience with Directory Services
"I haven’t worked directly with directory services like Active Directory or LDAP in my past roles. However, I’ve built secure, scalable systems that integrate with identity-related APIs, such as the real-time government ID verification (PAN, Aadhar) I implemented at Vauld for KYC compliance. I also have experience designing multitenant architectures and secure APIs with token-based authentication, which I believe gives me a strong foundation to quickly adapt to JumpCloud’s identity and access management focus. I’m eager to dive into this space and apply my cloud and distributed systems expertise to it."

#### 2. Specific AWS Services
"I’ve worked extensively with AWS services beyond EC2, RDS, and S3. For example, I’ve used ECS Fargate for containerized workloads, Batch for scheduled jobs, and Lambda for serverless functions, which I’ve optimized for cost and performance. I’ve also leveraged IAM to manage access control in multitenant environments securely. At Astuto AI, I integrated these services into tools like CloudScope and CostGuard, ensuring efficient resource collection and policy-driven optimization across AWS accounts. I’m confident I can bring this experience to JumpCloud’s cloud-native platform."

#### 3. Team Leadership
"I’ve led a team of four engineers, focusing on mentoring them to design robust solutions and debug complex issues. For instance, at Astuto AI, I guided my team through building CostGuard, helping them think through fault-tolerant designs and optimize SQL policies. I encourage a collaborative approach—teaching them to break down problems, prototype solutions, and debug efficiently. Beyond my team, I sync with product managers to gather requirements and translate them into technical requirement documents, and I work closely with front-end teams to ensure end-to-end feature delivery. This cross-functional collaboration has been key to delivering impactful projects."

#### 4. JumpCloud-Specific Tools
"I haven’t used JumpCloud’s platform directly as a user or admin, but I’m very familiar with the tools in its ecosystem, like Terraform and Kubernetes, which I’ve used extensively for infrastructure-as-code and container orchestration. My work on CloudScope, for example, involved deploying fault-tolerant collectors across AWS using Docker and Kubernetes. I’m excited to learn JumpCloud’s specific implementation and apply my skills to enhance its capabilities."

### Updated "Why JumpCloud" (with Reason for Change)
"I’m drawn to JumpCloud because it’s solving a critical problem—unifying identity, access, and device management into a seamless cloud platform—which aligns with my passion for building efficient, scalable systems. My work at Astuto AI on CostGuard, a B2B tool we sell to customers to optimize AWS cloud bills, has given me deep experience in cloud finops, cost optimization, and multitenant architectures, which I see directly supporting JumpCloud’s mission to simplify IT operations. I’m impressed by JumpCloud’s cross-platform support and innovative approach, and I’d love to contribute to its growth while growing alongside a talented team.

As for why I’m looking to make a change, at Astuto, there’s no dedicated PM or DevOps role, so I’ve been juggling product management—gathering requirements from product teams and drafting technical specs—alongside DevOps responsibilities like CI/CD and infrastructure maintenance, on top of my engineering work. This, combined with long hours and daily office requirements, has disrupted my work-life balance. I’m seeking a role at JumpCloud where I can focus on engineering excellence, collaborate with a structured team, and regain that balance while contributing to impactful projects."

### Updated Preparation Guidance

#### Incorporate New Details
- **Syncing with Product/Front-End Teams**: When discussing projects (e.g., CostGuard or CloudScope), mention how you bridged the gap between product requirements and technical execution. Example: “I worked with product teams to gather detailed requirements for CostGuard, translating them into technical specs, and collaborated with front-end engineers to deliver a cohesive tool that’s now sold to customers for AWS cost optimization.”
- **CostGuard Context**: Emphasize its B2B nature and AWS focus: “CostGuard is a tool we developed at Astuto AI, a B2B cloud finops company, to help customers guard their AWS bills by identifying savings opportunities through policy-driven analysis.”
- **Reason for Change**: Weave this into behavioral questions like “Why are you looking to leave your current role?” or “What are you looking for in your next opportunity?” Keep it professional: “I’m seeking a role where I can focus on engineering, work with a structured team, and maintain a healthier work-life balance.”

#### Revised STAR Stories
- **Cost Optimization (CostGuard)**: “At Astuto AI, a B2B cloud finops company, I led the development of CostGuard, a tool we sell to customers to reduce AWS bills. My task was to create a policy engine to identify savings. I built SQL-based rules to detect underutilized resources, integrated it with ticketing systems, and synced with product teams to align on customer needs, achieving 25% cost reductions for our clients.”
- **Collaboration**: “At Astuto, I worked with product teams to gather requirements for CloudScope, dumping their inputs into technical requirement docs. I then collaborated with front-end engineers to deliver a multi-account AWS analyzer, ensuring the full feature was completed end-to-end.”

#### Technical Prep Refinement
- **AWS Focus**: Since CostGuard is AWS-specific, be ready to discuss ECS Fargate, Lambda, and IAM in depth. Example question: “Design a Lambda-based system to monitor resource usage across AWS accounts.” Tie it to CostGuard’s architecture.
- **Identity Management Bridge**: If asked about directory services, pivot to your API/security experience: “While I haven’t worked with LDAP, my secure API design at LeadSquared and IAM usage at Astuto prepare me to learn JumpCloud’s approach quickly.”

#### Behavioral Prep Addition
- **Handling Multiple Roles**: “At Astuto, I’ve taken on PM and DevOps duties—like drafting TRDs and managing CI/CD—due to team gaps. It’s honed my versatility, but I’m eager to focus on engineering at JumpCloud with a balanced workload.”
- **Questions for Them**: Add: “How does JumpCloud structure its PM and DevOps roles to support engineers?” or “What’s the team’s approach to maintaining work-life balance?”
