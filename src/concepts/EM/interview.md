### 1. Leadership and People Management
**Q: "Tell me about a time you mentored or coached someone. How did you help them grow?"**  
*Answer:*  
“In my current role, I’ve had the chance to mentor a few junior developers who were new to our codebase. One time, a junior was struggling to debug a complex issue in a feature they were building. Instead of fixing it for them, I walked them through my thought process—asking questions like, ‘What’s the expected output here?’ and ‘What happens if this input changes?’ Over a couple of sessions, I helped them build a mental framework for troubleshooting, not just that one bug. A few weeks later, they independently solved a similar issue and thanked me for teaching them how to think it through. It felt great to see them grow in confidence, and it made me realize I enjoy helping others level up.”

### 2. Technical Expertise
**Q: "How would you approach reviewing a system design proposed by your team?"**  
*Answer:*  
“As someone who’s spent over a decade coding, I’d start by looking at the design’s fundamentals—does it meet the requirements, is it scalable, and are there any obvious bottlenecks? I’d ask the team questions like, ‘How does this handle peak load?’ or ‘What’s the fallback if this component fails?’ to make sure they’ve thought it through. I wouldn’t rewrite it myself—I’d trust their expertise—but I’d draw on my experience to spot risks, like tight coupling or overcomplicated logic, that I’ve seen trip up projects before. My goal would be to guide them to a solid solution while keeping them in the driver’s seat, since I know how much ownership matters to developers.”

### 3. Project and Process Management
**Q: "How do you prioritize tasks when multiple projects are competing for your team’s time?"**  
*Answer:*  
“I haven’t managed a team’s full workload yet, but based on my experience as a developer, I’d start by understanding the business priorities—talking to the PM or stakeholders to see what’s driving revenue or customer impact. Then I’d look at the team’s capacity and skill sets to figure out what we can realistically tackle. For example, if one project’s a quick win with high visibility, I might prioritize it over a longer-term refactor, but I’d make sure to carve out time for tech debt so it doesn’t pile up. I’d also check in with the team—sometimes they know what’s most urgent from a technical perspective. It’s about balancing short-term wins with long-term health.”

### 4. Collaboration and Stakeholder Management
**Q: "Describe a time you had to push back on a product manager’s request. How did you handle it?"**  
*Answer:*  
“I’ve been part of PM discussions where they push for tight deadlines or extra features. Once, a PM wanted to add a new feature to a release that was already stretched thin. I explained that squeezing it in would mean cutting corners on testing, which could lead to bugs in production—something I’d seen happen before. I laid out the trade-offs in simple terms: ‘We can do this, but it risks X, or we can delay Y to keep quality high.’ They appreciated the clarity, and we agreed to scope it down. I’d take that same approach as an EM—be upfront, focus on what’s doable, and keep the team’s perspective front and center.”

### 5. Behavioral and Culture Fit
**Q: "Why do you want to move from a developer role to an engineering manager?"**  
*Answer:*  
“I’ve loved coding for over 10 years—it’s where I’ve built my skills and solved tough problems. But lately, I’ve found a lot of satisfaction in mentoring juniors and seeing them succeed with my guidance. I’m starting to see how I could have a bigger impact by leading a team, setting them up to deliver great work while I tackle challenges like aligning tech with business goals. It’s a shift—I’d miss hands-on coding—but I’m excited to grow into a role where I can shape projects and people, not just code. It feels like the next step to use everything I’ve learned.”
