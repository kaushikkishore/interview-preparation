# Go Algorithm Implementation Concepts

## 1. Concurrency Patterns

### Concurrent Merge Sort

**Key Concepts:**
- Divide and conquer algorithm parallelized with goroutines
- Recursive partitioning of slices into smaller segments
- Use of sync.WaitGroup to coordinate completion of goroutines
- Potential optimization with worker pools to limit goroutine creation
- Performance considerations:
  - For small inputs, sequential is faster due to goroutine overhead
  - Optimal performance usually achieved with worker count close to CPU count
  - Speed improvements typically scale with available cores

### Pipeline Processing with Backpressure

**Key Concepts:**
- Stages connected with buffered channels for data flow
- Generator → processor → sink pattern
- Backpressure handling techniques:
  - Buffered channels to absorb temporary throughput spikes
  - Non-blocking sends to detect downstream congestion
  - Rate limiting to slow production when needed
  - Dynamic scaling of worker pools at bottlenecks
- Context-based cancellation for clean shutdown
- Monitoring of channel depths for observability

### Dining Philosophers Problem (Deadlock Prevention)

**Key Concepts:**
- Classic concurrency problem demonstrating deadlock scenarios
- Common solutions in Go:
  1. **Hierarchical resource allocation**: Acquire forks in consistent order
  2. **Central arbiter (waiter)**: Use a manager to grant resource access
  3. **Semaphore approach**: Limit concurrent diners to N-1
  4. **Timeout and retry**: Release resources if complete acquisition takes too long
- Implementation considerations:
  - Mutex for resource locking
  - Channels for coordination
  - Context for cancellation
  - Monitor for deadlock detection

## 2. Standard Library Optimization

### String Building Optimization

**Key Concepts:**
- String concatenation (+) creates new strings on each operation (O(n²))
- bytes.Buffer provides mutable byte collection with better performance (O(n))
- strings.Builder (Go 1.10+) specialized for string building with less overhead
- Pre-allocation strategies when size is known
- Performance implications:
  - Small string operations: String concatenation is acceptable
  - Large string operations: strings.Builder with Grow() offers best performance
  - bytes.Buffer useful when also doing byte-level operations

### JSON Serialization Optimization

**Key Concepts:**
- Standard json.Marshal allocates memory for entire output
- Streaming with json.Encoder reduces memory usage for large structures
- Optimization techniques:
  - Struct tags for controlling field output (`omitempty`, `-`)
  - Custom MarshalJSON() implementation for specific types
  - Pre-allocated buffers to reduce GC pressure
  - Parallel processing for large arrays
  - Pooling of encoders and buffers for high throughput
- Alternative libraries:
  - json-iterator/go: Drop-in higher performance replacement
  - easyjson: Code generation approach
  - ffjson: Faster for specific use cases

### Sort Interface vs. sort.Slice

**Key Concepts:**
- sort.Interface requires implementing Len(), Less(), Swap()
- sort.Slice (Go 1.8+) allows inline comparison functions
- Performance characteristics:
  - sort.Slice typically faster due to avoiding interface method calls
  - sort.Interface better for reusable sorting implementations
  - sort.SliceStable preserves order of equal elements
- Implementation considerations:
  - Multi-field sorting complexity
  - Memory allocation behavior
  - Algorithm remains quicksort-based in both cases

## 3. Advanced Data Structures in Go

### Trie (Prefix Tree)

**Key Concepts:**
- Tree-like structure for efficient string operations
- Each node represents a character in a sequence
- Optimization strategies:
  - Map-based children for sparse character sets
  - Array-based children for dense/limited character sets
  - Compression for single-child paths (Patricia trie)
- Concurrency considerations:
  - Fine-grained locking of nodes
  - Read-write mutexes for read-heavy workloads
  - Copy-on-write for traversal safety

### Thread-Safe Priority Queue

**Key Concepts:**
- Based on heap.Interface implementation
- Thread safety mechanisms:
  - Mutex protection for all operations
  - Condition variables for blocking behavior
  - Timeout handling for bounded waits
- Features for practical use:
  - FIFO ordering for equal priorities
  - Dynamic priority updates
  - Multiple consumer/producer patterns
  - Blocking and non-blocking dequeue options

### Graph Implementation with Concurrent BFS

**Key Concepts:**
- Adjacency list representation for memory efficiency
- Thread safety considerations:
  - Read-write mutex for graph/vertex access
  - Atomic operations for visited tracking
- Concurrent BFS implementation approaches:
  - Worker pool model
  - Channel-based job coordination
  - Synchronization of traversal completion
- Performance optimizations:
  - Bounded worker count
  - Buffered channels to reduce contention
  - Proper termination detection
